# TODO

Dated 2026-08-30. Ship of StopFailure force-switch + dynamic check cadence + comment strip (branch feat/stopfailure-dynamic-check).

- [x] Diagnose the Fable switch (probe fail-silence, no StopFailure hook)
- [x] StopFailure hook: classify, stamp, force, retrigger marker
- [x] Dynamic check cadence (60s floor tick, 60-300s self-paced)
- [x] Delete every code comment (owner ruling 2026-08-30)
- [x] Test suite green with the new tests (379 pass, 1 skip, 0 fail after the plugin.json version fix)
- [x] Docs: switching, state directory, limitations
- [x] AGENTS.md and .memory updates
- [x] Bump to 1.9.0
- [x] Review the diff: three finders ran; the refuter panel was killed mid-run (owner: "Don't spam fable like that", recorded in fable-fanout-is-quota-spend.md); findings verified by hand instead
- [x] Fix the eight confirmed findings (resolved reset carried into the enforcement, unmeasured-account pin, anticipatory only with an enforcement, proof anchored on the error row, tick-start due anchoring with half-tick slack, bare `check` unconditional with `--if-due` for the timer, systemd AccuracySec 5, quickstart cadence text); two refuted (marker gate has both arms, dismissed-countdown suppression is by design)
- [x] Edited test files green (41 pass), tsc clean
- [x] swap-concurrency e2e after the fixes: ALL PASS
- [x] Full suite after the fixes: the one flake was my own new tick-anchor assertion (1ms clock skew), replaced by a slow-probe anchoring test; then 384 pass, 1 skip, 0 fail on two consecutive full runs, tsc clean
- [x] Commit the review fixes by explicit path
- [ ] PR, CI, review window, merge, release v1.9.0, verify npm
