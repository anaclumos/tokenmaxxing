# TODO

Dated 2026-08-30. Ship of StopFailure force-switch + dynamic check cadence + comment strip (branch feat/stopfailure-dynamic-check).

- [x] Diagnose the Fable switch (probe fail-silence, no StopFailure hook)
- [x] StopFailure hook: classify, stamp, force, retrigger marker
- [x] Dynamic check cadence (60s floor tick, 60-300s self-paced)
- [x] Delete every code comment (owner ruling 2026-08-30)
- [x] Test suite green with the new tests (379 pass, 1 skip, 0 fail after the plugin.json version fix)
- [x] Docs: switching, state directory, limitations
- [x] AGENTS.md and .memory updates
- [x] Bump to 1.9.0
- [ ] Adversarial review of the diff, fix findings
- [ ] PR, CI, review window, merge, release v1.9.0, verify npm
